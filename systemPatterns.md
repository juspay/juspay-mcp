# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The system utilizes a microservices-oriented architecture (assumption, to be verified) where different components communicate via APIs. Schema definitions are crucial for ensuring data consistency and correct communication between these services.

## Schema Management
- **Source of Truth:** `juspay_dashboard_mcp/api/schema_control.json` is designated as the authoritative source for API schema definitions.
- **Application Layer Validation:** Pydantic models in `juspay_dashboard_mcp/api_schema/` are used within the Python application (likely a FastAPI or similar framework) for request/response validation and data serialization/deserialization.
- **Synchronization Need:** A process is required to keep the Pydantic models in sync with `schema_control.json`. The current task addresses this by manually (assisted by tooling) updating the Pydantic models based on a diff.

## Data Flow (Simplified for Schema Context)
1. External/Internal Client makes an API request.
2. API Gateway/Load Balancer routes the request to the relevant service.
3. The service (Python application) uses Pydantic models to validate the incoming request payload.
4. Business logic is processed.
5. The service uses Pydantic models to serialize the response payload.
6. Response is sent back to the client.

## Key Design Patterns
- **Single Source of Truth (SSoT):** `schema_control.json` aims to be the SSoT for schemas.
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC) or similar:** Pydantic models can be seen as part of the "Model" layer in such patterns, defining data structures.
- **Data Validation:** Pydantic provides robust data validation capabilities based on Python type hints.

## Potential Future Enhancements
- **Automated Synchronization:** Explore tools or scripts to automatically generate Pydantic models from `schema_control.json` or vice-versa, or to continuously validate consistency.
- **Schema Registry:** For larger systems, a dedicated schema registry could be considered.
