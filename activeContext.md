# Active Context

## Current Focus
The primary focus is on **Phase 1** of the schema synchronization task:
- Identifying and adding any parameters (fields) that are defined in `juspay_dashboard_mcp/api/schema_control.json` but are missing from the corresponding Pydantic models in `juspay_dashboard_mcp/api_schema/`.
- Identifying and correcting any discrepancies in the `required` status of parameters between `schema_control.json` and the Pydantic models.

## Input Files for Current Task
- **`juspay_dashboard_mcp/api/schema_control.json`**: The source of truth for schema definitions.
- **Pydantic model files**: Located in `juspay_dashboard_mcp/api_schema/`. These are the files to be updated.
- **`schema_comparison_diff.txt`**: Contains the detailed list of differences identified in the previous task. This will be the main guide for making changes.

## Recent Decisions & Discoveries
- A detailed comparison between `schema_control.json` and Pydantic models has already been performed, and the results are in `schema_comparison_diff.txt`.
- The update process will be phased. Phase 1 (current) addresses missing fields and `required` status. Phase 2 (future) will handle type discrepancies.
- Manual (assisted) updates to Pydantic models are the current approach.

## Immediate Next Steps (Planning Phase)
1. Finish creating all core Memory Bank files.
2. Create/Update `currentTask.md` with a detailed plan for Phase 1.
3. Read and analyze `schema_comparison_diff.txt` to identify the first set of Pydantic models and fields that need modification.
4. Cross-reference with `schema_control.json` to confirm the exact definitions to be applied.
5. Formulate a strategy for applying these changes to the Pydantic model files.

## Open Questions/Assumptions
- **Pydantic Version:** Assuming a Pydantic version that supports `Optional[<type>]` and `Field` for default values, descriptions, etc. (Likely Pydantic V1 or V2, V2 preferred for `Field` usage).
- **Import Strategy for Pydantic Models:** How are common types (e.g., `datetime`, `UUID`) and Pydantic features (`BaseModel`, `Field`, `Optional`, `List`) typically imported in the existing Pydantic model files? Consistency should be maintained.
- **Error Handling for Updates:** How to handle cases where a change suggested by the diff might conflict with existing Pydantic model logic or Python syntax. (For now, aim for direct application of schema rules).
- **Docstrings vs. `Field(description=...)`:** The `techContext.md` mentions translating JSON schema descriptions. The preferred method (docstring or `Field`) should be consistent. `Field(description=...)` is generally more explicit for Pydantic.

## Project Insights
- Maintaining schema consistency is a critical ongoing concern.
- The `schema_comparison_diff.txt` is a valuable asset for this task.
- A phased approach helps manage complexity.
