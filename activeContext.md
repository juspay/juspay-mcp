# Active Context

## Current Focus

 **COMPLETED TASK** : Successfully added two new integration monitoring APIs to the juspay_dashboard_mcp project:

1. **`get_integration_platform_metrics_juspay`** - Platform-based product integration query
2. **`get_integration_product_count_metrics_juspay`** - Product count by integration type query

These APIs support the ReScript Euler Dashboard UI functionality for platform dropdown population, product selection logic, and integration health calculation.

## Input Files for Current Task

* **`juspay_dashboard_mcp/api/integrationChecklist.py`** : Updated with new API functions
* **`juspay_dashboard_mcp/api_schema/integrationChecklist.py`** : Updated with new schema classes
* **`juspay_dashboard_mcp/tools.py`** : Updated to expose new tools
* **`currentTask.md`** : Task documentation and progress tracking

## Recent Decisions & Discoveries

* Successfully implemented API payload structures matching the provided curl examples
* Added proper schema validation with optional fields (debug, source, platform filters)
* Integrated new tools into the MCP server tool registry
* Both APIs use the same endpoint but with different groupBy parameters and metrics
* Proper error handling and response formatting maintained consistency with existing APIs

## Immediate Next Steps

 **Task Complete** : All implementation phases have been successfully completed:
* ✅ Phase 1: Added new API functions with proper payload structure
* ✅ Phase 2: Created schema definitions with validation
* ✅ Phase 3: Updated tools.py and documented usage

 **Ready for next task or return to schema synchronization work if needed.** 

## Open Questions/Assumptions

* **Pydantic Version:** Assuming a Pydantic version that supports `Optional[<type>]` and `Field` for default values, descriptions, etc. (Likely Pydantic V1 or V2, V2 preferred for `Field` usage).
* **Import Strategy for Pydantic Models:** How are common types (e.g.,  `datetime`,  `UUID`) and Pydantic features (`BaseModel`,  `Field`,  `Optional`,  `List`) typically imported in the existing Pydantic model files? Consistency should be maintained.
* **Error Handling for Updates:** How to handle cases where a change suggested by the diff might conflict with existing Pydantic model logic or Python syntax. (For now, aim for direct application of schema rules).
* **Docstrings vs. `Field(description=...)`:** The `techContext.md` mentions translating JSON schema descriptions. The preferred method (docstring or `Field`) should be consistent. `Field(description=...)` is generally more explicit for Pydantic.

## Project Insights

* Maintaining schema consistency is a critical ongoing concern.
* The `schema_comparison_diff.txt` is a valuable asset for this task.
* A phased approach helps manage complexity.
