# Project Brief

## Project Name
Schema Synchronization between JSON Schema and Pydantic Models.

## Project Goal
To ensure consistency and alignment between schema definitions stored in `juspay_dashboard_mcp/api/schema_control.json` (JSON Schema) and the Pydantic models located in the `juspay_dashboard_mcp/api_schema/` directory.

## Scope
- Analyze differences between the two schema sources.
- Update Pydantic models to reflect the `schema_control.json` definitions.
- Phase 1: Add missing parameters and correct `required` status discrepancies.
- Phase 2: Address type differences (future focus).

## Key Stakeholders
- Development Team

## Success Criteria
- Pydantic models in `juspay_dashboard_mcp/api_schema/` accurately reflect the structure and constraints defined in `juspay_dashboard_mcp/api/schema_control.json` for Phase 1 items.
- A clear process for maintaining synchronization in the future.
