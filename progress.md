# Project Progress: Schema Synchronization

## Overall Project Status: Phase 1 Partially Completed / Paused

## Current Date: 2025-05-18

## Milestones & Phases:

### Phase 0: Initial Setup & Analysis (Completed)
- **Task:** Compare `schema_control.json` with Pydantic models in `juspay_dashboard_mcp/api_schema/`.
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Output:** `schema_comparison_diff.txt` generated, detailing discrepancies.
- **Notes:** Iterative refinement of matching logic was performed.

### Phase 1: Pydantic Model Updates - Missing Fields & Required Status (Partially Completed / Paused)
- **Task:** Update Pydantic models to add missing fields and correct `required` status based on `schema_control.json` and `schema_comparison_diff.txt`.
- **Status:** Partially Completed / Paused.
    - [x] Memory Bank files creation initiated.
    - [x] `currentTask.md` created and updated with detailed plan for Phase 1.
    - [x] Analysis of `schema_comparison_diff.txt` for specific changes performed.
    - [x] Partial implementation of changes in Pydantic models (offer.py, gateway.py).
    - [ ] Further implementation paused by user.
    - [ ] Verification of changes (pending resumption and completion).
- **Expected Outcome:** Pydantic models accurately reflect `schema_control.json` regarding field presence and `required` attributes.

### Phase 2: Pydantic Model Updates - Type Discrepancies (Future Focus)
- **Task:** Address differences in parameter types between `schema_control.json` and Pydantic models.
- **Status:** Not Started.
- **Notes:** Will require careful consideration of representational vs. functional type differences.

## Key Decisions Log:
- **2025-05-17:** Decided to proceed with a phased approach for Pydantic model updates. Phase 1 focuses on missing fields and `required` status.
- **2025-05-17 (Previous Task):** `schema_control.json` designated as the source of truth.
- **2025-05-17 (Previous Task):** `schema_comparison_diff.txt` generated to guide updates.
- **2025-05-18:** User opted for direct camelCase naming in Pydantic models instead of using `alias` where names differ from `schema_control.json`.
- **2025-05-18:** User denied some proposed changes for `settings.py` and `user.py`.
- **2025-05-18:** User decided to pause Phase 1 after partial completion of updates to existing matched Pydantic models. Creation of new models for "Type 1" discrepancies is on hold.

## Blockers/Risks:
- **Complexity of Diff:** The `schema_comparison_diff.txt` might be extensive, requiring careful, iterative processing.
- **Pydantic Nuances:** Ensuring correct Pydantic syntax for optional fields, default values, and type hints (e.g., `Optional`, `List`, `Dict`, `Field`).
- **Potential for Introducing Errors:** Manual updates carry a risk of introducing typos or logical errors if not done carefully.
- **Scope Creep for Phase 1:** Need to strictly adhere to only addressing missing fields and `required` status in this phase.

## Next Steps (Overall Project):
1. Await user direction on resuming or re-strategizing Phase 1.
2. If resuming, complete updates for remaining matched schemas or create new models as per "Type 1" discrepancies.
3. Verify all Phase 1 updates.
4. Plan and execute Phase 2.
5. Consider long-term solutions for automated schema synchronization.
