# Product Context

## Problem Definition
The system relies on two sources for API schema definitions: a central `schema_control.json` file (JSON Schema) and a set of Pydantic models in the `juspay_dashboard_mcp/api_schema/` directory. Discrepancies between these two sources can lead to:
- Inconsistent API behavior.
- Data validation errors.
- Difficulties in maintaining and evolving the API.
- Confusion for developers consuming the API.

## User Experience Goals
- **Consistency:** Developers (both internal and external, if applicable) should have a consistent and reliable understanding of the API schema, regardless of which definition source they consult.
- **Reliability:** API requests and responses should be validated against a single, authoritative source of truth, minimizing unexpected errors.
- **Maintainability:** The process of updating and managing API schemas should be streamlined and less error-prone.
- **Clarity:** Schema definitions should be clear, well-documented, and easy to understand.

## Target Users
- Software Developers (integrating with or working on the API).
- API Consumers.
- Quality Assurance (QA) engineers.

## Desired Outcome
A synchronized and consistent set of API schema definitions, where `schema_control.json` serves as the primary source of truth, and Pydantic models are accurately reflecting these definitions. This will improve API reliability, developer experience, and overall system stability.
